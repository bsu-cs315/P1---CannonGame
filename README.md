Developed with the Godot Engine
Made by Colin Ferguson

## Project Report

### Reflection
In iteration 2 I now feel a little more confident when it comes to controlling mechanics in the game and code. Although I still am struggling and I feel that I still need a better understanding of how Godot and Github pages work. I think I hit every check mark except one of the stars that has something to do with the HUD. I just could not figure out how to make it interactable with the projectiles. Hopefully next iteration ill be able to get a better understanding of everything.

### Self Evaluation
- Meeting the following criteria earns a D or better grade; failing to meet these criteria earns an F grade:

[X]D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.

[X]D-2: The repository contains, in the top-level directory, a README.md file that includes the project identifier and author's name.

[X]D-3: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of M or less.

[X]C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate .gitignore file and no unnecessary files tracked.

[X]C-2: The repository is tagged using semantic versioning where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as normal for each change made to the minor version. The link submitted on Canvas is to the relevant release.

[X]C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the README.md file.

[X]C-4: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of T or less.

[X]C-5: The projectile and targets are shown with 2D graphics.

[X]C-6: The game plays an appropriate sound effect when the projectile is fired.

[X]B-1: The README.md file contains a personal reflection on the iteration as well as the reflections from previous iterations, if any.

[X]B-2: The README.md file contains a self-assessment.

[]B-3: The release is published to GitHub Pages with a link provided in the README.md file.

[X]B-4: Earn one star.

[]A-1: Earn three stars.

I only got two stars so I wouldnt get an A. But I think I hit everything else.
